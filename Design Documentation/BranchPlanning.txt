BranchPlanning
Purpose:
    summarize intent for key branches

master
    this will eventually become the latest & greatest 'stable' code
        with all included functions working as expected

develop
    starting 2019 June 15 => this will be the main branch for working code
    ie. Work In Progress

libtaskMemoryTest
    Branch used to evaluate the Dave Anderson libtask library
    par back code to bare minimum with libtask library
    identify why it appears that Arduino heap size is positive and looks normal at first
        -> but then goes to negative values after libtask scheduler() starts 
    also includes diagnostics code to better understand runtime memory usage
    also includes initial changes to clean up RAM and console whitespace gobbling console.log messages

openLoopQuickTrip
    Simplest possible implementation of the DPRG Quick Trip contest
    First prepared for 11 May 2019 DPRG RoboRama
    Simply turns motors to their 'full but matched' values for a fixed time.
        then reverses them.
    Demonstrates that open loop 'can work' pretty well for steady state
        ie. for a certain battery voltage & motor condition
        => except that when accelerating, especially when starting out,
            the motors show a significantly different acceleration
            and hence the robot starts moving randomly to left or right,
            then goes straight for a while,
            then turns slightly as it slows down to a halt

interruptScheme
    given apparent issues in getting the libtask library to behave well,
    this branch provides 'hello world' exercises for using interrupt service routines
