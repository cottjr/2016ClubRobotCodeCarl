Thoughts and plans for "ClubCar DonkeyBot"

2019 March 2
- solder & swap out Monster Motor Shield
    verify symmetrical encoder behavior
- Mega: load & run club_robot_nav1.ino
    verify console log output as expected
    verify move() task performs as expected
        task_def.cpp
        wpt_funcs.cpp
- Uno: load & run club_robot_display-16x2.ino
    verify console log output as expected
    verify display & button behavior as expected
    hack out / clean up stuff that behaves poorly when serial port not connected
        =>  perhaps add a 'heartbeat' broadcast on Mega, around 1 Hz
            detect lack of 'heartbeat' on Uno and console log: 
                "Mega: no heartbeat from serial port"
                "rPi: no heartbeat from serial port"
            maybe also display 'Mega: NoHartBeat' (maybe add to health check menu pick?)
- Robot - Base Logic
    think about onboard display UI
        2 line display
        6 buttons (left / right / up / down / select / ???)
    Main Menu
        Start / Stop        // start / stop currently selected run mode
        Select Run Mode     // keep multiple scripts available onboard, e.g.
                                    Out and Back
                                    4 corner
                                    Donkey Car
                                    Line Follower
        Test Subsystems     // exercise actuators, read sensors
        Health Monitor      // details e.g. Mega or rPi communication links down
- Robot Mechanical
    screw down lift blocks & paint the 'lift stand'
    add mount for rPi and Camera 
        (maybe account for / plan for future upgrade to camera tilt or pan/tilt?)
    add structure to lay on it's top w/o any special stand
- Raspberry Pi - Donkey Car
    select communication path   (serial port / 2-wire / or measure servo signals)
    add output from rPi
    add listener to Mega
